# Walk Through

This thinks to the main CTF site. There must be a flag hidden in there somewhere. 

First step, view page source and search for any string beginning with 'brunner{'

No dice.

## I am Insane

Turned out to be a game on their site. Hover the mouse over the floating cakes 1337 times and the flag reveals itself.

Fun stuff.
