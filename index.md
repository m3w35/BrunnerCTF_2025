> The Brunner Bakery began in the late 1980s, when Birgitte Brunner traded a respectable career in accounting for a far more dangerous life of hot ovens. The shop, tucked along a cobblestone street in the heart of Denmark, became legendary for a [brunsviger](https://sundaybaker.co/brunsviger-danish-coffee-cake/) that still remains unmatched to this day.  
>   
> For decades, life at the bakery was simple: knead, bake, glaze, repeat. But in the last few years, their fame rocketed from “best in town” to “international pastry powerhouse.” Competition got jealous, cutthroat and sticky. That's when strange things started happening.  
>   
> One morning, Birgitte unlocked the bakery and froze. The room looked staged: her **Pie Recipe** had been tampered with. The stainless **Whisk** had clearly been weaponized, not to whip but to cipher the text, making it impossible to read.  
>   
> Overhead, an unforgivable Nik & Jay earworm looped, some bootleg remix that could only be called **Bake and Forth**, while the receipt printer muttered `PUSH POP DROP` like a tiny stack machine. In the back office, the server rack now hosted a game, not just any game, an **Un-Pirateable Baking Game**, so aggressively DRM'd that it demanded a license key before it would open the till.  
>   
> Birgitte tied her apron, squared her shoulders, and sighed. This wasn't vandalism, this was a dare. The competition hadn't just crossed a line, they'd iced it in buttercream and invited her to slip.  
>   
> So she did what any sensible baker would do when faced with a string of pastry-related crimes: she hired freelance detectives to get to the bottom of it.
